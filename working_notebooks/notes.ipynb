    "- 5/6/21 (Steve/Nayani):\n",
    "  - Use statistics to classify time series for all polygons\n",

    "  - Consider how I can fit trends lines to the raw Sentinel 2/Landsat time series\n",
    "  - Steve: \n",
    "    - 10 years of monitoring is required after any significant intervention (e.g. seeding, re-seeding) until bond release\n",
    "    - Issues at McKinley: achieving good cover but plant functional type makeup is a bit out of whack; i.e. more shrubs than grasses, more of a particular type of grass is required.\n",
    "- 6/3/21 (Nayani):\n",
    "  - Discussed calibration of Sentinel 2 with Landsat 8 time series; would need to identify coincident scenes, calculate NDVI and then perform linear regression. Apply gain and offset to Landsat 8 NDVI. Nayani will work on code to do this.\n",
    "  - Smoothing windows with 12 month average:\n",

    "    - https://coderzcolumn.com/tutorials/data-science/how-to-remove-trend-and-seasonality-from-time-series-data-using-python-pandas#6\n",
    "  - Next steps:\n",
    "    - Calculate slope\n",
    "    - Perform unsupervised classification of smoothed temporal curves\n",
    "    - Investigate correlations between seeding unit data and classes\n",
    "- 6/10/21 (Steve):\n",
    "  - Comparison of NDVI time series trends with weather climate:\n",
    "    - Compare precipitation and temperature from winter to summer seasons with NDVI time series\n",
    "    - Compare annual NDVI trends extracted from long-term trends; i.e. what is short term weather-NDVI linkage\n",

    "- Bond release boundaries: split up into OSM and MMD locations, examples include Areas 2 and 10 etc...\n",
    "- VMU's encompass bond release boundaries but are more generalized, Golder overseas vegetation monitoring program:\n",
    "  - MMD VMU 1 through VMU 4\n",
    "  - OSM VMU 1 through VMU 8\n",
    "- Sections, land survey sections, none for Navajo Nation\n",
    "- Seeding units: document different extents, periods, and types of seeding activities\n",
    "  - Seeding at different months; how does month of seeding impact success re-seeding\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### Ideas\n",
    "- What is trajectory of different vegetation indices and how do these relate to different vegetation functional types? i.e. shrubs vs grasses?\n",
    "- Is NDVI actually useful? Can it quantify shrubby cover?\n",
    "  - Mixture model?\n",
    "- Potential statistical analyses:\n",
    "  - 1) Is there a relationship between the general temporal trends in NDVI and when units were seeded/re-seeded?\n",
    "  - 2) What is the trend/slope in NDVI after seeding/reseeding over the short and long term?\n",
    "  - 3) What is the impact of weather/climate variables on the NDVI trends over the short and long term?\n",
    "  - 4) Is there a relationship between acres seeded/re-seeded and weather/climate variables? Was there a hold put on seeding efforts due to drought conditions?\n",
    "  - 5) Are there seeding units of concern?\n",
    "    - Are there seeding units where the trend in NDVI is lower than the mean? \n",
    "    - Are there areas that cross-cut seeding units that are of concern; can we identify pixels with this trend and define new seeding units for future action?\n",
    "    - Are there areas with lots of grasses and strong greenup?"
