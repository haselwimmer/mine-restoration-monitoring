    "- Import and filter seeding units data\n",
    "- Extract Landsat and Sentinel 2 time series for each seeding unit\n",
    "- Perform smoothing, curve fitting of time series data\n",
    "- Perform unsupervised classification of time series for all SU polygons\n",
    "- Analysis of seeding unit classes? What do these classes represent? Is there a correlation between seeding unit properties (e.g. seeding start) and classes identified from classification\n",
    "- Analyse classes with reference to climate/weather data"

    "  - Steve: \n",
    "    - 10 years of monitoring is required after any significant intervention (e.g. seeding, re-seeding) until bond release\n",
    "    - Issues at McKinley: achieving good cover but plant functional type makeup is a bit out of whack; i.e. more shrubs than grasses, more of a particular type of grass is required.\n",
    "- 6/3/21 (Nayani):\n",
    "  - Discussed calibration of Sentinel 2 with Landsat 8 time series; would need to identify coincident scenes, calculate NDVI and then perform linear regression. Apply gain and offset to Landsat 8 NDVI. Nayani will work on code to do this.\n",
